# Data Management and Analysis Practicum Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive practicum projects completed during my graduate program. Each project showcases different aspects of database management, data warehousing, and analytical querying. The projects involve working with different types of databases (MySQL, SQLite), data extraction from various formats (CSV, XML), and implementing complex data transformation pipelines.

### Practicum I: Bird Strikes on Aircraft Database

This project involved building a relational database to analyze bird strike incidents on aircraft using a dataset from the FAA. The tasks included schema design, data loading, SQL querying, and basic data analysis using R.

### Practicum II: Pharmaceutical Sales Data Warehousing

This project focused on transforming data from XML documents into a transactional database in SQLite and then into an analytical database in MySQL using a star schema. The final part of the project involved executing complex analytical queries and generating reports.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Database Design**: Designed and implemented both OLTP and OLAP databases, ensuring data integrity and optimizing for performance.
- **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Extracted data from CSV and XML formats, transforming it to fit normalized and star schema designs.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Executed complex SQL queries for both transactional and analytical purposes, showcasing advanced querying skills.
- **ETL Pipeline Implementation**: Developed scalable ETL processes to handle large datasets efficiently between different database systems.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Analyzed data using R, providing insights through visualization and SQL-based reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL/MariaDB**: Relational database management system used for OLAP database creation and analytical querying.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database used for transactional data storage and management.
- **R and RStudio**: Primary tools for data extraction, transformation, and interaction with databases.
- **XML/CSV**: Source formats for data, requiring complex parsing and transformation.

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate a comprehensive approach to managing and analyzing complex datasets, highlighting proficiency in both database management and data analytics. Each project contributes to a robust understanding of how to effectively design, implement, and query databases for various use cases.
